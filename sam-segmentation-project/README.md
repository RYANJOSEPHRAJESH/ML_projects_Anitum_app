SAM Segmentation Project
This project explores image and video segmentation using Metaâ€™s Segment Anything Model (SAM 2.1). The goal is to demonstrate how SAM can be applied to real-world scenarios such as object detection, CCTV footage analysis, and scene understanding.

Using both static images and video frames, the project showcases:

Efficient segmentation of arbitrary objects

Prompt-based interactions (e.g., point, box)

Real-time visualizations using SAM's high-accuracy masks

This serves as a foundation for advanced applications in retail monitoring, autonomous systems, and intelligent video analytics. Detailed Description will be given in the pdf.
